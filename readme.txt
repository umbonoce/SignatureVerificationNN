In this project we could run three scripts (first we have to install dependencies) referening to the work "OnlineSignatureVerification_Nitti_Nocerino.pdf" in this folder:

- main_gmm.py, we could run functions:
	- start_fs() to run feature selection for the 29 users of xLongSignDB
	- testing() to run testing of performances (features are yet provided in "features_GMM.csv")


- main_hmm.py, we could run functions:
	- start_fs() to run feature selection for the 29 users of xLongSignDB
	- testing() to run testing of performances (features are yet provided in "features_HMM.csv")


- knn+gmm.py, we could run functions:
	- knn_experiment() to run the last experiments mentioned on document "OnlineSignatureVerification_Nitti_Nocerino.pdf"
